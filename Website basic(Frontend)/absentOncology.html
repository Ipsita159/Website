    <h3>
        We follow an integrative treatment approach, seamlessly combining medical, surgical, and supportive 
        therapies to deliver personalized cancer treatment plans. Our specialized surgical oncology teams cover a
        wide range of cancers, including Head & Neck, Breast, Gynecological, Gastrointestinal, Urological, Thoracic,
        Bone & Soft Tissue, and Paediatric Oncology. Each surgical case is thoroughly evaluated and planned through 
        collaborative decision-making.
        Our cancer care model is the Multidisciplinary Tumor Board, where experts from Medical Oncology, Surgical 
        Oncology, Radiology, Pathology, and other specialties come together to discuss every patient’s case in 
        detail. This ensures a comprehensive, multimodal treatment plan tailored to each individual, promoting the
        best possible outcomes.
        Our commitment extends beyond medical treatment. We offer comprehensive supportive care services, including 
        counseling, dietary and nutritional guidance, physiotherapy, and rehabilitation to support patients throughout
        their cancer journey.
        Our Oncosurgery team specializes in breast-conserving surgeries and oncoplastic procedures, providing 
        world-class surgical care while maintaining quality of life and aesthetics. Every case is managed meticulously 
        with input from the Tumor Board to ensure a cohesive and well-rounded treatment strategy.
        As part of our expansion, we are strengthening our hematology services and moving towards offering bone marrow 
        transplant services, supported by advanced in-house laboratory diagnostics, cell separation technologies,
        and a well-equipped blood bank.
