    10 Tips for Heart Health</h1>
    <h3>
    Simple changes that keep your heart functioning at its best
    Cardiovascular health plays a vital role in overall well-being. 
    The heart works continuously to supply oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, and maintaining its health requires consistent, preventive care. 
    The following evidence-based tips support long-term heart function and help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
    1. Stay Physically Active
    Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most days.
     Regular movement improves circulation, strengthens the heart muscle, and helps regulate blood pressure.
    2. Follow a Balanced Diet
    A heart-healthy diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
     Limiting processed foods and saturated fats supports healthy cholesterol levels.
    3. Maintain a Healthy Body Weight
    Excess body weight increases strain on the heart and raises the risk of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease.
     A balanced diet and regular activity help maintain optimal weight.
    4. Control Blood Pressure
    High blood pressure often has no symptoms but can damage arteries over time. 
    Reducing salt intake, managing stress, and following medical guidance are essential preventive measures.
    5. Manage Cholesterol Levels
    Elevated cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries.
     Routine testing and lifestyle adjustments help maintain healthy lipid levels.
    6. Quit Smoking and Avoid Tobacco
    Smoking damages blood vessels and significantly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.
     Stopping tobacco use offers immediate and long-term cardiovascular benefits.
    7. Limit Alcohol Consumption
    Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure and weaken heart muscle function.
     Moderation is key to protecting cardiovascular health
