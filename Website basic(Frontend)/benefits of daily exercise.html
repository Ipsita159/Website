    Benefits of Daily Exercise</h1>
    <h3> 
    Why even 20 minutes a day can improve overall health
    Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining overall health and preventing chronic disease.
    Even a short period of daily exercise can lead to significant physical and mental health benefits. Consistency matters more than intensity, making exercise accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels.
    1. Improves Heart and Lung Function
    Daily exercise strengthens the heart muscle and improves circulation. It also enhances lung capacity, allowing the body to use oxygen more efficiently.
    2. Helps Maintain a Healthy Weight
    Even 20 minutes of activity helps burn calories, regulate metabolism, and prevent gradual weight gain when combined with balanced nutrition.
    3. Regulates Blood Sugar Levels
    Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, helping control blood glucose levels and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.
    4. Reduces Blood Pressure and Cholesterol
    Regular movement supports healthy blood pressure and improves cholesterol balance by lowering harmful LDL and increasing protective HDL.
    5. Strengthens Muscles and Bones
    Weight-bearing and resistance exercises improve muscle strength and bone density, reducing the risk of weakness, falls, and osteoporosis.
    6. Enhances Mental Well-Being
    Exercise releases endorphins that reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression while improving mood and emotional balance.
    7. Improves Sleep Quality
    Regular activity helps regulate the sleep cycle, enabling deeper and more restorative sleep
